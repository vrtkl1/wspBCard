				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<h3>Objective:</h3>
				<p>The objective of the website redesign of Orlando Tropical Transport is to create an organized information architecture in partnership with a more focused user experience. By condensing the amount of content and creating a new navigation structure, the site will be more effective at accomplishing two goals: having users fill out an online reservation form, or call the company directly to arrange for services.</p>

				<h2>Target Audience</h2>
				<h3>Overview:</h3>
				<p>The target audience for the site is extremely broad. Both male and female, single, married, families, and business people are all potential customers. Some focused target audiences include customers that require transportation to and from the area airports and cruise ship terminals, and to and from the local tourist attractions. There is also a large target audience of customers who require general transportation services such as taxi pick-up and drop-off at business and residential locations throughout the area. </p>
				<h3>Use Case Scenarios:</h3>
				<p>John Smith and his family(wife and two young children), are planning a vacation to the Orlando area. They require a shuttle at the airport to pick them up on the day that they arrive, and also to drop them off on the day that they depart. Also, Mr. Smith is interested in a shuttle from the hotel they are staying in to Disney world and back. On the website, Mr. Smith easily fills out an online reservation form for airport pickup and drop off, and finds fares and schedules for shuttle services to the area attractions.</p>
				<p>Jane Doeâ€™s car is in the shop for maintenance. She requires taxi service from her office to another office building 7 miles away. Using her mobile device to view the website, Mrs. Doe easily finds the phone number to call a representative who dispatches a taxi to her location. </p>
